Hey fellow Gamers!

I know it's been a while since I've posted, but I've got some exciting news!

Within the past few months, I've been able to secure a design paten for the 2nd iteration of the Klip 64! I'm very excited, as this is the first patent I've come into owning and it feels like a milestone
to have it gotten this far.

Also, in those past few months, I was able to finally make an LLC! We're incorprated as Klip 64 LLC, based out of delaware. I had a lot of help in handling how the business turns out, and for me, it seems
like this is the first few steps into seeing this long awaited item finally come to fruition.

We're not done yet though! In the time in between post, I've also been working on the (hopefully) final design for the Klip 64. This one I think will be the one, as I've been working with the design company
to help make sure that every possible idea or problem that may arise once we mass produce. Either way, I'm very excited to see what come next!

Even if nobody is reading this, I hope that someday someone will. Because if I make it and get famous or what not, I hope I'm always able to have these as a way to keep me grounded in what's to come :)


Thanks again

Sincerely,

Matthew Cochrane
