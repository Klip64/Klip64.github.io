Hey fellow Gamers!

I'm back with a few updates. I know it's been a while, but I've been working a bunch to stay afloat in life, and haven't had too much time to devote to the project.
But today, I have some exciting news! I sent in forums to the lawyer who helped me and we will soon be kicking this thing off as an LLC! I'm still waiting on the verdict
for the patent results, but I'm feeling pretty optimistic as it's a once and a lifetime invention. I am also looking into some new designs, as I went home a few weeks ago and talked
with the manufacturer about ways to make the invention better. I'm gonna send him over some other designs, and see what we can work out to make a better grip for the phone to the controller.

I'm sorry it's been a while, I don't really know if anyone is reading this, but overall I'm excited to see what the future holds!


Thanks again

Sincerely,

Matthew Cochrane
