Back at it again with some updates! 

So I think I'm going to form an LLC. It's kind of the obvious move, but I think it needs to be done in order to make the klip 64..well... well. 

I've talked with a family friend who is going to help me form the business, as I really don't have that much experience with running a business. I'm looking forward to working on our kickstarter soon. Hopefully by the end of the month, I'll be able to shoot the video I have written and put it out there for the world to see.
I know this website seems weird, without any pictures of the invention at all, but I'm keeping it "off the grid" at the moment as to not form competition yet.

I've got some good ideas I think you guys will like down the road, and I can't wait to share them with you.

Thanks again

Sincerely,

Matthew Cochrane
